# Lab9: A Spring-Mass System: Part 2

## Objective

In this activity you will extend the program you wrote in activity Lab7: A Spring-Mass System, Part 1.  Before doing this activity you should have studied Section 5.11.

After completing this activity you should be able to:


* Explain the flow of energy in a vertically oscillating spring-mass system.
* Explain the shape of a graph of K+U for a spring-mass system subject to a dissipative force (either air resistance, viscous friction, or sliding friction).

*This notebook is adopted from the Lab VP08 materials from Matter & Interactions 4e*
