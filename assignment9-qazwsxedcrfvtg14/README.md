# Computer Homework 9

## Objectives

In Chapter 15, we found an analytical expression for the  electric field along the axis of a uniformly charged ring. For a general observation location,  we have to compute the electric field numerically.


After completing this activity you should be able to:
* Create and use lists of many source charges and many observation locations in VPython
* Calculate and display the net electric field of a macroscopic uniformly charged object
* Discuss the effect of varying the number of point charges used to model a charged ring
* Compute the motion of a charged particle near a macroscopic uniformly charged object

## To do

* Finish the code to compute the electric field at different observation locations due to a uniformly charged ring.
* Simulate the motion of an electron in this electric field. 

## Submission 

* Tag the version you want to submit with: tag: "cw9" (all lower case)
