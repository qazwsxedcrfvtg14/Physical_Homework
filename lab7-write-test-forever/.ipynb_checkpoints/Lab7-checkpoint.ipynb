    "We have seen that masses connected by springs are a good model for many physical systems.  Before doing this activity you should have read Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 4.12 of the *Matter and Interactions, 4e* textbook. If you have not yet studied Section 5.6, you may omit the second item in part 5 of this activity.\n",

    "After completing this activity you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain how varying the mass of an oscillator affects the period of the system\n",
    "* Explain how varying the spring stiffness affects the period of the system\n",
    "* Explain what initial conditions are needed to produce oscillations in 3D (not in a line or a plane)\n",
