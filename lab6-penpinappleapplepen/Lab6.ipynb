    "In this activity you will model the motion of a spacecraft traveling from the Earth to the Moon.  You'll start with the program you wrote in a previous activity to model the interaction of a spacecraft with the Earth.  To simplify the model, we'll assume that the Earth and the Moon remain fixed in position, and only the spacecraft moves.  Before doing this activity you should have read Section 3.6 of the *Matter and Interactions, 4e* textbook, which discusses the structure of a computational model that includes the gravitational force; you should also have completed *A Space Voyage: Part 1*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this activity you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a program to model the motion of three or more gravitationally interacting objects\n",
    "* By varying initial speed, generate several very different spacecraft trajectories\n",
    "* Discuss the issue of sensitivity to initial conditions\n",

    "\n",
    "* Add a sphere representing the Moon.  The Moon's mass is $7\\times 10^{22}$kg and its radius is $1.75\\times 10^6$m.  The center to center distance between the Earth and the Moon is $4\\times 10^{8}$m.  In your program, place the Moon on the $x$ axis, to the right of the Earth.   \n",
    "* Modify your program to include the effect of the Moon on the spacecraft.  Think carefully about the changes you must make to do this.  To simplify the model, assume that both the Earth and the Moon are fixed in position.\n",
    "* Lengthen the time your loop will run to 60 days or more, in order to be able to follow more complex orbits.\n",
    "* Use an initial velocity of $\\langle 0, 2\\times 10^3 ,0\\rangle$m/s, and a time step of 10s. To make the program run faster you can increase to `rate(1e4)`. What do you see when you run your program?  \n",
