# Lab6: A Space Voyage: Part 2

## Objective

In this activity you will model the motion of a spacecraft traveling from the Earth to the Moon.  You'll start with the program you wrote in a previous activity to model the interaction of a spacecraft with the Earth.  To simplify the model, we'll assume that the Earth and the Moon remain fixed in position, and only the spacecraft moves.  Before doing this activity you should have read Section 3.6 of the *Matter and Interactions, 4e* textbook, which discusses the structure of a computational model that includes the gravitational force; you should also have completed *A Space Voyage: Part 1*.  

After completing this activity you should be able to:

* Write a program to model the motion of three or more gravitationally interacting objects
* By varying initial speed, generate several very different spacecraft trajectories
* Discuss the issue of sensitivity to initial conditions
