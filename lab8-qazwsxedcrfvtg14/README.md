# Lab8: A Space Voyage: Part 3

## Objective

In this activity you will extend the program you wrote in *VP06: A Space Voyage, Part 2,* to include energy in your model of the interaction of a spacecraft, the Earth, and the Moon.   Before doing this activity you should have studied Section 6.15 of the  *Matter and Interactions, 4e* textbook. 

After completing this activity you should be able to:

* Explain the flow of energy as a function of time for the system of a spacecraft and the Earth, in different orbits.
* Explain the flow of energy as a function of separation for the system of a spacecraft and the Earth.
* Explain the flow of energy as a function of time for the system of a spacecraft, Earth, and Moon.
* Explain the effect of your choice of $\Delta t$ (deltat) on the accuracy of your predictions.


*This notebook is adopted from the Lab VP08 materials from Matter & Interactions 4e*
